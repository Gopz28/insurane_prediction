1. Create a Virtual Environment
Use Python’s built-in venv module to create a virtual environment. This avoids the restrictions you’re seeing. Here’s how:

cmd:
python3 -m venv myenv
Replace myenv with the name you prefer for your virtual environment.

2. Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows cmd:

myenv\Scripts\activate


On macOS/Linux cmd:

source myenv/bin/activate

3. Install Jupyter and Other Packages
With the virtual environment activated, you can now install packages using pip without restrictions:

cmd:
pip install --upgrade pip  # Upgrade pip to the latest version
pip install jupyter

4. Install the IPython Kernel
To make the virtual environment available as a Jupyter kernel, install the IPython kernel:

cmd:
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv --display-name "Python (myenv)"

5. Launch Jupyter Notebook
Start Jupyter Notebook from within the virtual environment:
cmd:

jupyter notebook

6. Deactivate the Virtual Environment
When you're finished, deactivate the virtual environment by running:

cmd:
deactivate

Alternative: Using pipx for Application Installation
If you prefer or need to install Jupyter as a system-wide application with isolation, you can use pipx, which handles applications and their dependencies in isolated environments. First, ensure pipx is installed:

cmd:

python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath

Then install Jupyter using pipx:

cmd:

pipx install jupyter

Summary
Create and activate a virtual environment using venv.
Install Jupyter and other necessary packages inside the virtual environment.
Set up the IPython kernel to make the virtual environment available in Jupyter.
Launch Jupyter Notebook from within the virtual environment.
Following these steps should allow you to work around the system package management restrictions and manage your Python environments and dependencies effectively.
